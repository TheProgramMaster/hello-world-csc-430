My name is Gavin Johnson. I am a double-major senior student at Murray State University in Computer Science and Mathematics who happens to be in the honors college program as well. I hope to learn about software engineering techniques in this course to prepare for my software development career after I pursue my Master's degree with an emphasis in Software Engineering.
